# sqf-sys — Claude Code Reference

## Working Agreement (Tony, 2026-07-12)

Claude is authorized to run **all scripts and commands without asking for approval first** — builds, seeds, DB migrations/DDL, docker compose operations, service restarts, and test runs included. The same applies to executing the phases of an agreed plan: no per-step confirmation. Verification gates (typecheck, 6-service health check, E2E against real infra) replace check-ins. Still surface — rather than silently execute — anything that is genuinely new scope, contradicts the agreed design, or destroys data/work outside the plan.

**Conflicts between documented/claimed architecture and actual code must be checked with Tony, not silently resolved either way** (added 2026-07-16, after a concrete incident — see below). When something Claude wrote (a doc, a training artifact, an earlier claim in conversation) turns out to disagree with what the running code actually does, that disagreement gets surfaced and confirmed with Tony before landing a fix — don't just pick the side that seems more likely correct and proceed. This matters because both directions of error are easy: the doc/claim can be wrong, but so can Claude's reading of the code, and only Tony has the full context on which the system was actually supposed to do.

*Incident that prompted this:* the trade-directory training walkthrough said an organisation gets "no persona" if it's merely named on an invoice — backwards; per `InvoiceTradeNetworkService.ensureTradeNetwork`, being named as issuer/debtor on an invoice always assigns a Supplier/Buyer persona. Fixing the doc surfaced a real code inconsistency: `RelationshipService.create()` (the manual "+ New relationship" path) saved relationships without ever assigning personas, unlike the invoice path — confirmed live (`SUMMERSCAPE` had a `SUPPLIES_TO` relationship row but `supplierPersonaId IS NULL`). Fixed by extracting persona assignment into a shared `PersonaAssignmentService` (`apps/trade-directory/src/persona/`) used by both `InvoiceTradeNetworkService` and `RelationshipService`. The lesson isn't the specific bug — it's how easily a stale doc, a plausible-sounding claim, and an actual code gap can all look the same from the outside until someone checks the live data.

## Session Start Checklist

At the start of every session, verify all 6 microservices are healthy before doing any work:

```bash
for svc in trade-directory risk-operation customer-relationship-management document-management notification knowledge-graph; do
  echo -n "$svc: "; curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost/$svc/
done
```

All should return `404`. A `502` means the service's HTTP server is down (check `docker compose logs <service-name> --tail=50` for webpack/TypeScript errors). A `000` means the container itself is not running.

---

## What This Is

sqf-sys is a financial platform (supply-chain finance / invoice factoring) built as an Nx monorepo. It has 6 NestJS microservices and a React/Vite frontend.

---

## Monorepo Structure

```
sqf-sys/
├── apps/
│   ├── trade-directory/        # Auth, orgs, persons, JWT login, system setup
│   ├── risk-operation/         # Loan applications, risk scoring, KYC agency reports
│   ├── customer-relationship-management/  # Client assignees
│   ├── document-management/    # Document extraction, webhooks, API keys
│   ├── notification/           # Email sending (Kafka consumer)
│   ├── knowledge-graph/        # Neo4j projection of the trade network + GraphRAG opportunities
│   └── web/                    # React + Vite frontend (src/ inside)

├── docker-compose.yml
└── package.json                # Root — all deps merged here (Nx monorepo)
```

Each microservice has its **own PostgreSQL database**. Services communicate via **Kafka**.

---

## Running Locally

### Start backend (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up -d
# Wait ~30-40s for webpack builds to finish
docker compose ps   # all should be Up
```

### Start frontend (Vite, separate from Docker)
```bash
npm run serve:web          # http://localhost:3001
# Or background:
npm run serve:web > /tmp/vite.log 2>&1 &
```

### Stop
```bash
docker compose down        # keeps Postgres/Kafka data in volumes
```

### Restart a single service after code changes
```bash
docker compose restart trade-directory-service
# Wait ~15s for webpack hot rebuild, then check:
docker compose logs trade-directory-service --tail=10
```

### Health check all services
```bash
for svc in trade-directory risk-operation customer-relationship-management document-management notification knowledge-graph; do
  echo -n "$svc: "; curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost/$svc/
done
```
All should return 404 (no route at `/` is correct — means the service is up).

### Known boot issue
On a fresh Kafka boot, a service may crash with `KafkaJSProtocolError: UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION`. Fix: `docker compose restart <service-name>` once — topics auto-create on retry.

**Different from the above:** if *every* service is crash-looping with `KafkaJSConnectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND kafka`, the `kafka` container itself has likely exited (check `docker compose ps kafka`) — `docker compose up -d kafka` first, then restart the dependent services. See "Backend changes required to support a second frontend origin" under "Planned: Frontend Rebuild" for the full container-ops notes (this + the `.env`-doesn't-reload-on-`restart` and nginx-IP-caching gotchas) surfaced while standing up `apps/web-next`.

---

## Key Commands

### Run seed script (SQFSYS bootstrap account)
```bash
docker compose exec trade-directory-service \
  npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register \
  apps/trade-directory/src/scripts/seed-funder.ts
```

### Backfill missing relationship personas (one-off, idempotent)
```bash
docker compose exec trade-directory-service \
  npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register \
  apps/trade-directory/src/scripts/backfill-relationship-personas.ts
```
Fixes existing `SUPPLIES_TO` relationships created before the 2026-07-16 `RelationshipService` persona-assignment fix (see Working Agreement above). Safe to re-run — no-ops on organizations that already have the persona.

### Manual DB migration (POSTGRES_SYNCHRONIZE=false for all services)
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d "trade-directory" \
  -c "ALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS system_role VARCHAR;"
```
Replace `trade-directory` with the target DB name, and the SQL with whatever DDL is needed.

### Connect to a service's DB
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d "trade-directory"
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d "risk-operation"
# etc.
```

## Architecture

### Auth Flow (email/password)
1. `POST /trade-directory/auth/organizations` — returns orgs for the email
2. `POST /trade-directory/auth/login` — returns `{ accessToken, refreshToken }`
3. Tokens stored in cookies (`access_token`, `refresh_token`) via `js-cookie`
4. `GET /trade-directory/api/person/me` — returns logged-in person profile

Microsoft SSO (MSAL) has been removed from the platform. Email/password JWT is now the only auth flow, frontend and backend.

Frontend uses two axios clients, both JWT-cookie-based now that MSAL is gone:
- `axiosClient` (`apps/web/src/api/axiosClient.ts`) — used by Login, SystemSetup, and the login/logout services. Reads `access_token` from cookies, retries once on 401 via `/trade-directory/auth/refresh`, and redirects to login if refresh fails.
- `apiClient` / `publicClient` (`apps/web/src/utils/reactQuery.ts`) — same cookie + refresh pattern, used by the SQF screens. Kept as a separate client rather than merged with `axiosClient` to avoid a cross-cutting refactor; both should stay behaviorally in sync if either's refresh logic changes.

The legacy LCM subsystem (pre-SQF loan-case-management screens and backend modules) was fully removed on 2026-07-12 — see docs/design/lcm-removal-assessment.md for what went and what was deliberately kept.

### SQFSYS System Role
- `tony.murphy@synlian.net` / `Hann@h12` — platform-level system administrator
- Has `system_role = 'SQFSYS'` in the `person` table (no org membership)
- Login returns sentinel org `{ id: 0, name: 'SQF System' }` — org dropdown is hidden
- After login, frontend redirects to `/system-setup`
- `SystemSetupGuard` (not `AuthGuard`) protects the initialize endpoint — verifies JWT directly without requiring `funderPersonaId`
- SQFSYS creates the Funder Organization and first Super Admin through the UI
- **Initialization scope is deliberately narrow (confirmed 2026-07-17):** SQFSYS only sets Funder Org + Super Admin parameters. Everything else — roles, `role_permission` rows, product/lending configuration, etc. — starts empty/reset; the appointed Super Admin must configure all of it via their own Super Admin portal (see "Planned: Dynamic RBAC, Multi-Tenancy and Role-Based Dashboard" below). SQFSYS does not seed defaults for any of it.
- In production, Funder initialization happens through the **SQFSYS Admin Portal** (see "Planned: SQFSYS Admin Portal" below), not this dev-only `/system-setup` screen — that screen assumes a single shared deployment; production provisions a new isolated Funder deployment per subscription.

### Route Guards (frontend)
- `PrivateRoute` (defined in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`) — checks JWT `refresh_token` cookie. The only route guard in the app; use for every protected route.
- `ProtectedRoute` (MSAL-based) has been removed along with Microsoft SSO. Routes that used it now use `PrivateRoute` wrapped in `<Layout>` directly (the `Layout` wrapping `ProtectedRoute` used to provide automatically).

### POSTGRES_SYNCHRONIZE
Set to `false` in all services. New entity columns **do not auto-create**. Always write a DDL migration and run it manually before running seeds or deploying.

---

## Messaging Architecture (Kafka)

**Rule: Never call `kafkaProducer.emit()` directly.** Always use the transactional outbox pattern.

### Publisher side
Write an `outbox_event` row in the **same DB transaction** as the business change. A relay cron job (`OutboxRelayService`) polls every 5 seconds and emits to Kafka.

### Consumer side
Before processing any Kafka message, check `processedEventRepository.exists(eventId)`. If already processed, skip. Otherwise process + insert `processed_event` row in the same transaction.

### Entities (libs/common)
- `OutboxEvent` — `libs/common/src/database/outbox-event.entity.ts`
- `ProcessedEvent` — `libs/common/src/database/processed-event.entity.ts`

### Kafka topic roles per service
| Service | Publishes | Consumes |
|---|---|---|
| risk-operation | SEND_EMAIL | — |
| trade-directory | RECEIVE_KYC_REPORT, SEND_EMAIL, ORGANIZATION_CREATED | REQUEST_KYC_REPORT |
| customer-relationship-management | — | CREATE_CLIENT_ASSIGNEE |
| notification | — | SEND_EMAIL |
| document-management | — | SQF_DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION |
| knowledge-graph | — | RELATIONSHIP_UPSERTED, CONTRACT_UPSERTED, INVOICE_STATUS_CHANGED |
| risk-agent | — | APPLICATION_SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW, ORGANIZATION_CREATED |

Dormant since the LCM removal (2026-07-12): nothing currently publishes REQUEST_KYC_REPORT or CREATE_CLIENT_ASSIGNEE, and nothing consumes RECEIVE_KYC_REPORT — the old producers/consumers lived in the deleted LCM modules. The trade-directory redesign (docs/design/trade-directory-redesign.md) re-introduces the triggers; the topics and trade-directory's KYC consumer are kept.

Every Kafka message type must have `eventId: string` at the top level.

### Trade network & knowledge graph (built 2026-07-13)

The trade-directory redesign (docs/design/trade-directory-redesign.md) is implemented:
- **Tables** (trade-directory DB): `relationship` (directional SUPPLIES_TO), `contract` (FACILITY_AGREEMENT | COMMERCIAL), `invoice` (status machine in `invoice.service.ts` — keep `InvoiceStatusTransitions` in `apps/web/src/constants/enum.ts` in sync), `lending_product_subscription`. All writes emit outbox events (topics above).
- **`invoice` mirrors OASIS UBL 2.5** (2026-07-13, source `SQF ARCHITECTURE/SCEHMA/ubl-invoice-*`): header carries the UBL LegalMonetaryTotal (lineExtensionAmount/taxExclusiveAmount/taxInclusiveAmount/payableAmount — no more flat `amount`/`currency`) plus SQF lending fields (funderPersonaId, lendingProduct, status machine) on the same row. New tables: `party` (immutable per-document snapshot of supplier/customer, separate from `organization`, optional `organizationId` link), `invoice_line` (+ `invoice_line_tax_category`, `invoice_line_additional_item_property`), `invoice_note`, `invoice_additional_document_reference`, `invoice_payment_means`, `invoice_tax_subtotal`, `invoice_allowance_charge`. `CreateInvoiceDto` takes **lines only** — `InvoiceService.buildLinesAndTotals` computes all totals/tax-subtotals server-side so they can't drift from the lines. Party snapshots auto-generate from the Organization at create time. See docs/design/trade-directory-redesign.md §3.3.
- **APIs**: `/trade-directory/api/relationships|contracts|invoices|lending-product-subscriptions|trade-directory/organizations` — JwtAuthGuard'd, tenant-scoped by resolving `funderPersonaId` from the caller's org (403 if the caller's org is not a funder).
- **Frontend**: `apps/web/src/screens/SQF/TradeDirectory/` under `/directory/*` routes (NOT `/trade-directory/*` — that prefix belongs to the Vite dev proxy). Nav group "Trade Directory" in AdminLayout.
- **knowledge-graph service**: consumes the three trade-network topics, projects them into Neo4j (`neo4j:5` in compose, browser at http://localhost:7474, bolt 7687, auth neo4j/sqfgraph). Graph is a projection — rebuild any time with `docker compose exec knowledge-graph-service npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register apps/knowledge-graph/src/scripts/rebuild-graph.ts`. Idempotency via ProcessedEvent nodes (graph-side equivalent of processed_event). Opportunities API `/knowledge-graph/api/opportunities` (3 saved GraphRAG queries; `POST .../query` NL→Cypher needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in apps/knowledge-graph/.env, off by default).
- Dev test user for the funder-scoped APIs/screens: `admin@sqf.local` / `Test@1234`, orgId 2.

### Document tables (built 2026-07-14)

Two S3-backed document tables live in trade-directory, both entities in `apps/trade-directory/src/models/`:
- **`person_supporting_document`** — reintroduced (existed in the original 2024 schema — NRIC scan → S3 `bucketKey` — dropped during the 2026-07-13 redesign, brought back verbatim). `personId` FK → `person`, `supportingDocumentType` enum (`PersonSupportingDocumentTypeEnum`, currently just `NRIC`).
- **`organization_document`** — new. Org-level artefacts (`OrganizationDocumentTypeEnum`: business registration cert, tax registration cert, audited financials, bank statement, company profile, other), `organizationId` FK → `organization`, S3 pointer (`bucketName`/`objectKey`/`fileName`/`mimeType`/`fileSizeBytes`), optional `uploadedByPersonId` FK → `person`.

Both are registered in `trade-directory.module.ts`'s `DatabaseModule.forFeature` + `providers` (repository only, following the `KycAgencyReportRepository` pattern — **no service/controller/API yet**, so there's no upload endpoint or actual S3 client wiring. Build that as its own task when the document-upload UI is scoped, reusing the S3 patterns.

### Auto-created organizations + Risk Agent KYC pickup (built 2026-07-14)

`POST /trade-directory/api/invoices` can now auto-create a bare `Organization` for an issuer/debtor that doesn't exist yet: `issuerOrganizationId`/`debtorOrganizationId` are optional, and an inline `newIssuerOrganization`/`newDebtorOrganization` (`NewOrganizationDto` — only `organizationName` required) can be supplied instead. Exactly one of {id, inline-new-org} is required per side. Before creating, it dedups by `businessRegistrationNumber` when given, else falls back to exact `organizationName` match (same weaker check the dormant `SQF_CREATE_ORGANIZATION` Kafka handler already uses) — there is **no DB unique constraint backing this**, so it's correct for the realistic sequential case but not a concurrency guarantee (see `InvoiceTradeNetworkService.resolveOrCreateOrganization`). A newly-created org emits `ORGANIZATION_CREATED` (payload: `organizationId`, `organizationName`, `businessRegistrationNumber`, `country`, `source: 'invoice_issuer' | 'invoice_debtor'`, `funderPersonaId`) — only on genuine insert, never on a dedup-matched reuse. `fullyOnboardedAt` stays null, same as every org today.

**The Risk Agent now consumes `ORGANIZATION_CREATED` and runs a KYC-intake task on every newly added organization (built 2026-07-14).** `apps/risk-agent/src/organization-kyc/` — `OrganizationKycController` (`@EventPattern(KafkaTopicEnum.ORGANIZATION_CREATED)`, idempotent via `ProcessedEventRepository`, same pattern as `QueueController`) hands off to `OrganizationKycService.runKycCheck`, which calls `RiskAgentService.runOrganizationKycTask` — a parallel, purpose-built LLM tool-use loop (separate from the application-review `runTask`, since that one requires an `applicationId`/`applicationNumber` baked into `NOT NULL` DB columns with no organization-only path). The task calls `check_compliance` and `get_financial_credit_report` (already organization-scoped, reused unchanged) and must conclude by calling the new `propose_organization_kyc_outcome` tool, which persists a `CLEAR`/`FLAGGED` outcome + confidence + reasoning to a new `organization_kyc_recommendation` table (`apps/risk-agent/migrations/002-organization-kyc.sql`) — same shadow/suggest-mode philosophy as application review: the agent never clears or flags an org itself, a Human Risk Analyst confirms or overrides via `PATCH /api/crc-dashboard/organization-kyc/:id/resolve`.

**Known limitation, not fixed:** a KYC task that errors or exhausts its 8-turn cap without proposing an outcome leaves no persisted trace — mirrors an existing accepted gap in the application-review `runTask` (a failed task there also only logs), not a new regression, but worth tightening later if it needs a "processing failed" signal on a dashboard.

**Why:** an invoice naming an unknown counterparty (a client's supplier, or Companies D/E/F/G under an SCF facility) shouldn't be blocked just because that org has no directory record yet — but a bare, auto-created record has had zero KYC, so it needs a real trigger to get vetted rather than silently sitting unreviewed.
**How to apply:** resolving a KYC recommendation via `PATCH /api/crc-dashboard/organization-kyc/:id/resolve` only updates risk-agent's own audit trail — trade-directory's `Organization` has no verification/KYC status field to write back to today. If the directory UI ever needs to show KYC status on the org record itself, that's a new field + a Kafka event from risk-agent back to trade-directory, not built.

### Bank account data belongs to the Payment service, not trade-directory (decided 2026-07-14)

A `bank_account` table existed in trade-directory's original 2024 migration but was dropped during the 2026-07-13 redesign and never carried forward — this was correct and should stay that way. When the Payment microservice (see "Domain structure" → Finance below, and `agents/` product-agent docs) gets designed and built, bank account details (account holder, bank, account number, SWIFT/branch codes, verification status) belong there, not in trade-directory.

**Why:** bank accounts are disbursement/settlement targets with their own verification lifecycle (e.g. penny-drop checks) — that's Payment's job, not trade-directory's (identity, KYC, and the trade graph). Putting it here would couple an identity service to payment-specific compliance logic it shouldn't own.
**How to apply:** Payment references organizations/persons by bare `organizationId`/`personId` int, same pattern already used by risk-operation and customer-relationship-management — no cross-DB FK. If the directory UI needs to show bank-verification status alongside org profile data, use a Kafka event (e.g. a future `BANK_ACCOUNT_VERIFIED`) rather than a shared table or synchronous cross-service read on every page load.

### Related-party attributes (director, shareholder, product, ...) are a graph-computed pattern, not a `relationship` row (decided 2026-07-14)

Shared director, shared shareholder, same lending product, and other common-attribute links between two organizations are **not** modeled as rows in the Postgres `relationship` table. `RelationshipTypeEnum` stays limited to the directional trade type it already has (`SUPPLIES_TO`); its own code comment already anticipated this — `SUBSIDIARY_OF`/`SHARES_DIRECTOR_WITH` are marked "reserved for later (knowledge-graph driven)". This decision confirms and generalizes that: any "these two orgs are connected because they share X" fact is a **computed graph pattern in knowledge-graph (Neo4j)**, discovered by querying the projected data, not an explicit row anyone inserts.

**Why:** `relationship.fromOrganizationId`/`toOrganizationId` model a directional trade flow (supplier→buyer) — a shared director or shareholder is symmetric, so it doesn't fit that shape without either faking a direction or double-storing the pair. There's also no reliable trigger moment for it the way invoice creation states issuer/debtor directly: a shared director is *derived* by joining `OrganizationPerson` rows across two `organizationId`s, and `OrganizationPerson.designation` is free text today (`"Director"`, `"Managing Director"`, ...), not a structured field — no create()-time hook to hang this on. And it's a related-party/conflict-of-interest signal (Bank Negara relevance), not a trade fact, so it shouldn't silently look like one in the trade graph.

**How to apply:** when this gets built, it means (1) projecting `Person` nodes and `Person -[:MEMBER_OF {designation}]-> Company` edges into Neo4j (trade-directory doesn't currently emit any event when `OrganizationPerson` rows change — a new topic/consumer would be needed, mirroring the existing `RELATIONSHIP_UPSERTED`/`CONTRACT_UPSERTED`/`INVOICE_STATUS_CHANGED` pattern), (2) structuring shareholder data as real entities/edges rather than the free-text/jsonb blob currently buried in `KycAgencyReport.shareholders`, and (3) projecting `LendingProductSubscription` so "same product" is a graph pattern too. The actual "shared director" fact is then a Cypher query (e.g. two `Company` nodes reachable from the same `Person` node via `MEMBER_OF`), exposed through the existing GraphRAG opportunities API pattern (`apps/knowledge-graph/src/opportunities/`) — not a new Postgres migration. Not built yet; this is a design decision only.

## Coding Conventions

### NestJS modules
- Each feature has its own `Module`, `Service`, `Controller`, `Repository`
- Repositories extend `AbstractRepository<T>` from `libs/common` (requires `id: number` PK — **not** for outbox/processed-event repos, use standalone `@Injectable()` with `@InjectRepository()`)
- `DatabaseModule.forFeature([...entities])` in each feature module's imports
- Shared enums live in `libs/common/src/apps/trade-directory/enums/`

### Frontend
- React + Mantine UI components throughout
- `apps/web/src/constants/routes.tsx` — all route constants
- `apps/web/src/constants/enum.ts` — frontend-side enums (must stay in sync with `libs/common` enums)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/` — React Query hooks
- `apps/web/src/service/` — raw API call functions
- **Redesign in progress (2026-07-07):** the gold `#c7760a` primary action colour has been replaced. Source of truth for the palette/typography is `apps/web/design-system/sqf-sys/MASTER.md` — accent/CTA `#0369A1` blue, `#0F172A` navy. **Implemented** in the Mantine theme (`App.tsx`'s `createTheme`: `primaryColor: 'primary'`, `colors.primary`/`colors.navy` tuples generated from those two hexes, `fontFamily: 'Inter'`, `headings.fontFamily: 'Calistoga'`, fonts loaded via Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html`). All 7 places that previously hardcoded `#c7760a` inline now use `color="primary"`.
- **Known debt — legacy hardcoded colors bypass the theme.** `apps/web/src/constants/color.tsx` defines a separate hardcoded palette (`GOLD: '#B0A275'`, `DARKBLUE`, `FHGREEN`, etc.) referenced ~30 times via inline `style={{ backgroundColor: color.GOLD }}` — this is why the Login screen and others still look gold-ish after the theme change; it was never `#c7760a` in the first place. Raw hex inline styles appear ~120 times across ~25 files app-wide, all bypassing the Mantine theme. Migrating this is a distinct, larger task — deliberately deferred (Tony's call, 2026-07-07), not an oversight. Do not assume the app is visually consistent with `MASTER.md` outside the 7 spots and the theme defaults until this migration happens.
- **No per-domain design-system page overrides.** The `ui-ux-pro-max` plugin's auto-generated per-page overrides (credit-risk, finance, compliance, etc.) were reviewed on 2026-07-07 and discarded — they resolved to generic e-commerce/marketing templates (checkout flows, product-review pages, lead-gen forms) unrelated to sqf-sys's internal authenticated screens, with some files duplicated verbatim across unrelated domains. For actual page structure per domain, use the Domain structure and work-queue design already specified by hand below (Planned: Dynamic RBAC, Multi-Tenancy and Role-Based Dashboard section) — not any auto-generated page file.

### TypeORM
- Column names: TypeORM default is camelCase → DB column. If the DB column is snake_case (e.g. `system_role`), add `{ name: 'system_role' }` to `@Column()` explicitly.
- Relations in `findOne`/`find` use string array form: `relations: ['organizationPersons', 'organizationPersons.organization']`
- Do **not** bump `typeorm` past `^0.3.x` — v1.x has breaking changes at ~30 call sites

### Package management
- All deps in root `package.json` (Nx monorepo — no per-app package.json)
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` for `npm ci` (Hashgraph SDK peer conflicts)
- Do **not** bump `@nestjs/common|core|microservices|platform-express` past `^10.x` — `@nestjs/axios@3` only supports Nest ≤10

---

## Testing Policy

All tests must be **end-to-end against real infrastructure** (real DB, real Kafka). No mocks unless explicitly requested. The reason: a previous incident where mocked tests passed but a prod migration failed.

---

## Security Notes (Financial Application)

All changes should be reviewed against:
- No raw SQL — use TypeORM query builder or parameterised queries
- No `console.log` in backend — use injected `Logger` (Pino)
- No hardcoded secrets — use `ConfigService` / env vars
- Rate limiting is applied to auth endpoints via `ThrottlerModule`
- Helmet.js is applied to all 5 services
- Cookies use `sameSite: strict`, `secure: true` in production

Open items not yet resolved:
- No HTTPS/TLS configured (required before production)
- 1 critical + 7 high npm vulns remain in `@hashgraph/sdk` transitive deps

---

## Security Model — Authentication

### Token lifecycle

1. **Login** (`POST /trade-directory/auth/login`)
   - Server bcrypt-compares the submitted password.
   - On success: issues a short-lived **access token** (15 min JWT) and a long-lived **refresh token** (7-day JWT).
   - Access token returned in the JSON response body.
   - Refresh token set as an **httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie** (`refresh_token`, path `/trade-directory/auth`). It never appears in the response body and is invisible to JavaScript — XSS cannot steal it.
   - A bcrypt hash of the refresh token is stored in the `token` table alongside session metadata (`issuedAt`, `expiresAt`, `userAgent`, `ipAddress`, `tokenFamilyId`).
   - `failedLoginAttempts` and `lockedUntil` are reset to 0 / null on success.

2. **Frontend token storage**
   - Access token is held in a **module-level in-memory variable** (`inMemoryAccessToken` in `axiosClient.ts`). It is never written to localStorage, sessionStorage, or any JS-readable cookie. It is lost on page refresh — by design.
   - On page load, if Redux has a persisted user identity, `SilentRefresh` (in `App.tsx`) calls `/auth/refresh` to restore the in-memory access token from the httpOnly cookie.

3. **Token rotation** (`POST /trade-directory/auth/refresh`)
   - Server reads the refresh token from the httpOnly cookie (not the request body).
   - Bcrypt-compares against all active token rows for this user.
   - If a match is found: the old row is revoked (`revokedReason = ROTATED`) and a new token row is created, sharing the same `tokenFamilyId`. A new httpOnly cookie is set with the new refresh token. The JSON response contains only the new access token.

4. **Logout** (`POST /trade-directory/auth/logout`)
   - Server reads the refresh token from the httpOnly cookie, revokes the matching row (`revokedReason = LOGOUT`), and clears the cookie (`Expires = epoch`). No token value is needed in the request body.
   - Frontend calls `setAccessToken(null)` to clear the in-memory access token.

### Automatic session revocation scenarios

| Trigger | What happens |
|---|---|
| Rotated token replayed (theft detected) | All active tokens in the same `tokenFamilyId` family are revoked (`ROTATION_ABUSE`). A security alert email is sent to the account holder via the Kafka outbox. 401 returned. |
| Refresh token expired (`expiresAt < now`) | Token row revoked (`FORCE_REVOKE`). 401 returned. |
| 5 consecutive wrong passwords | Account locked for 15 minutes (`lockedUntil`). Lockout alert email sent via Kafka outbox. |
| Account locked and login attempted | 429 returned with seconds remaining. Logged as `LOGIN_BLOCKED`. |

### Audit trail

Every auth event writes an append-only row to `auth_audit_log` (no UPDATE or DELETE on this table):
- Events: `LOGIN_SUCCESS`, `LOGIN_FAILURE`, `LOGIN_LOCKED`, `LOGIN_BLOCKED`, `REFRESH_SUCCESS`, `REFRESH_FAILURE`, `REFRESH_THEFT`, `LOGOUT`, `PASSWORD_RESET`
- Columns: `event`, `email`, `personId`, `outcome`, `detail`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `createdAt`

### Key files

| File | Role |

## Production Deployment Roadmap (Not Yet Started)

sqf-sys currently only runs in local dev (`docker compose` + Vite). Once local-dev build-out is complete, the next phase is standing up **production infrastructure on AWS** and **CI/CD**, with Claude Code acting as build-time Engineering Orchestrator (per [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)) helping Tony design and build it — not just code review it.

**IaC tool: Terraform.** All AWS infrastructure is defined as Terraform, not manual console/CLI changes — `plan` reviewed before every `apply`, consistent with the human-sign-off gate in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md).

Expect this phase to cover (none of it exists yet):
- AWS account/infra design for the 5 NestJS microservices + React/Vite frontend + Postgres (one DB per service) + Kafka — likely ECS/Fargate or EKS, RDS per service, MSK or a managed Kafka equivalent, S3 (already used for document storage), ALB/CloudFront for the frontend. All provisioned via Terraform.
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or equivalent) — build, test, deploy per service (including `terraform plan`/`apply` steps), since there's currently no `.github/workflows` and no automated pipeline at all.
- Closing the open security items above before going live: real TLS/HTTPS, `httpOnly` cookies, secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store instead of `.env` files), resolving the `@hashgraph/sdk` vulns.
- This also satisfies the Release Agent and Migration Agent roles described in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) (`agents/deploy/`), which are currently specs only, not implemented — building real CI/CD is what gives those agents something to actually run.
- **Per-Funder isolated provisioning, not a single shared prod stack (confirmed 2026-07-17).** Each Funder subscription gets its own bounded cloud environment/account with no shared network or DB — see "Planned: SQFSYS Admin Portal" below. This Terraform work needs to produce a repeatable per-Funder "stamp" (all services + DBs + Kafka provisioned fresh per Funder), not one shared production environment sized for many tenants. Cloud-account ownership model (Synlian-provisioned isolated account vs. Funder-supplied BYOC) is still open — settle before starting Terraform design.

**Sequencing:** do not start this until Tony explicitly says local dev is feature-complete — this is a roadmap note, not a current task.

## Multi-Tenancy & Data Governance (Future SaaS Phase)

sqf-sys is moving toward multi-tenant SaaS — multiple unrelated client organizations (Funders) each licensing the platform, served partly by [domain product agents](AGENT.md) (Risk, Sales & Customer Management, Payment, Finance & Accounting). These principles govern that phase and apply to every product agent's design from the start, not as a later retrofit:

**Deployment isolation model (confirmed 2026-07-17).** "Multi-tenant" here means multi-*customer*, not shared-infrastructure multi-tenancy: each Funder's subscription runs in its own bounded cloud environment and cloud provider account, with **no shared network, database, or data connection between Funders.** See "Planned: SQFSYS Admin Portal" below for the platform-operator layer that sits above these isolated deployments (Funder initialization, billing, security/IT-ops, cross-deployment data lake). This sharpens principle 1 below — isolation is enforced at the infrastructure level, not just application-level tenant scoping — and means the existing `funderPersonaId` row-level scoping used throughout trade-directory (Trade Directory Redesign, Dynamic RBAC below) is defense-in-depth *within* a single Funder's own deployment, not the production tenant boundary itself. That's a real gap between the row-scoping design as written and this deployment model — worth reconciling explicitly when the RBAC/dashboard work is actually built, not assumed either way.

1. **Tenant data isolation, with a Tony-level exception.** A product agent may never share another tenant's data or "experience" (learned patterns, extracted context, prior decisions) with a customer it is not contracted with. Cross-tenant leakage is a hard boundary, not a tunable setting. The one exception: agents may share **consolidated** (aggregated/anonymized, not raw per-tenant) experience and data with Tony, e.g. for platform-wide tuning, eval, and oversight. "Consolidated" means tenant-attributable detail has been stripped or aggregated away before it reaches that channel — a per-tenant record is never an acceptable substitute for a consolidated one.
2. **Daily reporting cadence for product agents.** Each product agent must produce a consolidated daily report to its human supervisor, delivered in both written and verbal form — modeled on a 15-minute daily scrum. This is an operational requirement on every domain agent's harness (see the Observability Agent and the agentic SDLC's "observe & iterate" phase in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md)), not optional telemetry.
3. **Extensible, tenant-agnostic data architecture.** Because SQF will run financial services SaaS for multiple clients, the data architecture must be designed so onboarding/migrating a new customer's data onto the platform is low-complexity and fast — not a bespoke schema or pipeline per tenant. Favor shared, parameterized schemas and migration tooling over one-off per-tenant customization from the outset.

**Status:** governance principles only — no multi-tenancy implementation exists yet (current per-service Postgres databases are single-tenant, single shared dev deployment). The deployment *model* (isolated per-Funder cloud environments) is now decided per above; the *implementation* — Terraform per-Funder provisioning, the SQFSYS Admin Portal, reconciling `funderPersonaId` row-scoping against deployment-level isolation — is not. Apply these as design constraints once multi-tenant work starts; do not treat their absence from the current schema as a gap to fix today unless Tony asks.

## Planned: SQFSYS Admin Portal (Platform Operator)

Decided 2026-07-17 (Tony). A new, separate portal — the **SQFSYS Admin
Portal** — is the platform-operator (Synlian) control plane across
every isolated Funder deployment described above. It is distinct from
the per-Funder **Super Admin portal** (the Dynamic RBAC /
role-based-dashboard work described below, which is tenant-scoped and
lives inside each Funder's own deployment, built by that Funder's own
appointed Super Admin). The SQFSYS Admin Portal:

1. **Initializes Funders** — creates the Funder Org + first Super
   Admin (same bootstrap scope as today's dev-only `/system-setup`
   flow, see "SQFSYS System Role" above), but in production this is
   the trigger that provisions a new isolated Funder deployment, not a
   row in a shared dev DB.
2. **Pulls data from Funder deployments into a central data lake or
   knowledge graph** owned by SQFSYS/Synlian — separate from each
   Funder's own `knowledge-graph` service instance, which stays scoped
   to that Funder's own trade network.
3. **Drives a single dashboard** for billing Funders and for managing
   security and IT operations across the whole fleet of Funder
   deployments.

**Status:** scope decision only, 2026-07-17. Not built — no
architecture decided yet for which service/app owns this portal, what
"data lake or knowledge graph" tech choice it uses, or how the data
pull works across environments that are required to have no shared
network/DB connection to each other (the pull target is presumably
the SQFSYS control plane on one side only, never a Funder-to-Funder
link — needs an explicit design before building).

**Open item — cloud account ownership model not yet specified.**
"Their own... cloud provider account" could mean Synlian provisions an
isolated account per Funder within Synlian's own cloud organization
(e.g. AWS Organizations, one account per Funder) or that each Funder
supplies their own external cloud account (BYOC). This materially
changes the Terraform/CI-CD design in "Production Deployment Roadmap"
below and should be settled before that work starts.

**Open item — data-pull scope vs. the tenant-isolation principle
above.** Principle 1 above says agents may share only *consolidated*
(aggregated/anonymized) data with Tony, never raw per-tenant records.
The SQFSYS Admin Portal's data-lake pull is platform-operator
telemetry (billing, security, IT ops) — a different category from a
product agent sharing tenant experience, closer to ordinary SaaS
vendor operational telemetry — but whether it pulls raw per-Funder
data or only aggregates hasn't been specified. Confirm with Tony
before building the pull mechanism.

## Marketing Agent (Synlian Organization, New)

A new [Marketing Agent](agents/growth/marketing-agent/AGENT.md) has been added to the Synlian Data@Source org under a new cross-cutting **Growth** group in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) — sibling to Build/Deploy/Operate/Governance/Target Domain Agents, but not gated by or gating the sqf-sys product SDLC.

- **Scope:** the marketing website (distinct from the product's own `apps/web`), promotional video scripting, social media marketing campaigns, and market research for SQF's go-to-market.
- **Status:** design phase, no production autonomy.
- **Key constraint:** because its output is public-facing (publishing, posting, ad spend), it inherits the "Explicit permission required" treatment from Claude Code's own safety rules — no autonomous publish/post/spend until Tony explicitly raises its autonomy tier, and any regulated financial-promotion claim requires Policy Agent + Tony sign-off first.

---

## Document Conversion (Markitdown)

[Microsoft Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) converts Word/Excel/PowerPoint documents to Markdown before LLM extraction. Markdown is far cheaper in tokens than raw OOXML-derived text and preserves structure (tables, headings) better than naive extraction.

**Status: implemented in `document-management`. AWS Textract OCR has been fully removed** — Markitdown is now the only document-conversion path for every supported mime type (PDF, PNG, JPEG, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX). `initiateDocumentExtraction()` in [document-extraction.service.ts](apps/document-management/src/modules/document-extraction/document-extraction.service.ts) converts the file via [markitdown.service.ts](apps/document-management/src/modules/markitdown/markitdown.service.ts) synchronously on upload and writes the result straight into `rawText`, with status set directly to `PENDING_LLM_EXTRACTION`. The `ocr` module, `OCR_SERVICE`, `PENDING_OCR` status, `handlePendingOCRCron`, and the `@aws-sdk/client-textract` dependency are all gone.

**Vision-LLM fallback for documents with no text layer (implemented 2026-06-25):** Markitdown does **not** do OCR. Its image converter only reads EXIF metadata (no text extraction); its PDF converter (`pdfminer.six`) only extracts text from PDFs that already have an embedded/selectable text layer. For PDF/PNG/JPEG, if Markitdown's output is below `MIN_VIABLE_TEXT_LENGTH` (20 non-whitespace chars) in [document-extraction.service.ts](apps/document-management/src/modules/document-extraction/document-extraction.service.ts), the file is re-sent through [vision-extraction.service.ts](apps/document-management/src/modules/vision-extraction/vision-extraction.service.ts), which calls Claude (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`, PDF via the `pdfs-2024-09-25` beta, images via the standard `image` content block) to transcribe the page images to Markdown.

**This is a generative transcription, not deterministic OCR — it has no confidence score and can misread fields, especially numeric ones (amounts, account numbers).** Per Tony's decision (2026-06-25), the result is therefore **not** trusted automatically: the row is set to a new `PENDING_REVIEW` status (added to `DocumentExtractionStatus`) instead of `PENDING_LLM_EXTRACTION`, and a human must call `POST /extraction/:requestId/approve` (or the future review UI) before the document proceeds to LLM field extraction. `extractionMethod` (`markitdown` | `vision_llm`) is stored on the row and returned in both the list and single-fetch API responses so reviewers can see which path produced the text. **Guardrails — the review workflow itself — are intentionally minimal for now** (a bare approve endpoint, no review UI, no confidence scoring, no audit trail beyond the status change) and are expected to be built out later, consistent with the [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) confidence framework's "below threshold → human review" principle.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env vars (same convention as `apps/risk-agent`).

**Why Markitdown needs Python, and why the base image changed:** Markitdown is a Python package (no Node runtime). Its `magika` dependency requires `onnxruntime`, which has **no Alpine/musl wheel** — `document-management`'s [Dockerfile](apps/document-management/Dockerfile) base image was changed from `node:18-alpine` to `node:18-bookworm-slim` (glibc) for this reason. Every other sqf-sys service stays on `node:18-alpine` unless it also needs Markitdown.

**Install pattern (apply to any new service needing Markitdown):**
- Local/Docker: `apt-get install python3 python3-venv`, then `python3 -m venv /opt/markitdown-venv && /opt/markitdown-venv/bin/pip install 'markitdown[docx,xlsx,pptx,pdf]'`. Use the `[docx,xlsx,pptx,pdf]` extras, not `[all]` — `[all]` pulls extra OCR/audio dependencies that aren't needed and don't change the Alpine-incompatibility either way.
- Install at a fixed path outside `WORKDIR` (e.g. `/opt/markitdown-venv`) so the same `MARKITDOWN_BIN_PATH`-style env var works across every Dockerfile stage/target, regardless of each stage's own `WORKDIR`/copy layout.
- **Never install into global/system Python** on a dev machine — it silently upgrades shared packages (pillow, protobuf) and can break unrelated Python projects (this happened once with a global install clashing with `streamlit`). Always use an isolated venv.
- Invoke via `child_process.execFile` (not `exec` — avoids shell injection) from the Node service, passing the file path as an argv element, never interpolated into a shell string.
- Apply this pattern to any sqf-sys service or future Synlian Data@Source project that converts Word/Excel/PDF/PowerPoint for LLM processing.

## Proto / gRPC Layer

`libs/common/src/apps/trade-directory/proto/entity.ts` contains proto-generated enums. When adding a new value to `libs/common/src/apps/trade-directory/enums/organization-person-role.enum.ts`, also add it to:
1. `proto/entity.ts` — `OrganizationPersonRoleEnum`
2. `proto-converter.ts` — both `convertToApp` and `convertToProto` maps
3. `apps/web/src/constants/enum.ts` — frontend enum

## Planned: Frontend Rebuild — Full Rewrite, Mantine Removed (scoped 2026-07-15)

Tony has decided sqf-sys's frontend will be completely rebuilt, not
incrementally migrated — **Mantine is being removed entirely.** The
replacement UI layer is the `ui-ux-pro-max` plugin's ui-styling stack
(shadcn/ui: Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS), which Tony has
installed locally. This supersedes the original, more open-ended
"state machine needs to change" flag from earlier the same day —
state management (currently Redux for persisted identity + React
Query for server state + ad-hoc local component state, no unified
state-machine library) is also in scope for reconsideration as part of
this rebuild, but not yet decided.

**Status: chassis scaffolded (2026-07-15), screens not started.** Tony
is providing the storyboard, navigation, and business logic as the
design input before real screens get built — the chassis below is
infrastructure only (auth, routing skeleton, base components), not a
green light to build domain screens without that spec in hand.

### `apps/web-next` chassis (built 2026-07-15)

A working, empty-of-domain-content app proving the stack end-to-end:
- **Stack**: Vite + React + TS on port 3002 (`apps/web-next/`, `project.json` mirrors `apps/web`'s `nx:run-commands` pattern). `npm run serve:web-next`, or `.claude/launch.json`'s `"web-next"` config.
- **UI layer**: Tailwind + shadcn/ui, `components.json` present so `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` works normally. Base components so far: `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Card` (`src/components/ui/`). Design tokens are placeholder neutral/slate HSL values in `src/index.css` — **not** the real visual identity, which lands via `ui-ux-pro-max` token generation separately.
- **Data layer unchanged, per the earlier decision**: `axiosClient.ts` (in-memory access token + refresh-cookie rotation), Redux (`redux-persist`, `user` slice), and `@tanstack/react-query` v5 are ported/reused as-is from `apps/web` — same backend, same auth model. One deliberate simplification: `apps/web`'s split between `axiosClient` and a separate `apiClient`/`publicClient` (`utils/reactQuery.ts`) is *not* carried over — `web-next` uses a single `axiosClient` everywhere, since that split was scar tissue from an incremental migration that doesn't apply to a from-scratch rebuild.
- **Auth flow proven live**: `screens/Auth/Login.tsx` (2-step email → password+org, same as `apps/web`) and a protected `screens/Home/Home.tsx` behind `PrivateRoute`, verified end-to-end against the real trade-directory service (login → `/api/person/me` → protected route), side by side with `apps/web` still working unmodified on 3001.
- **Routes are deliberately minimal** (`constants/routes.ts` — just `AUTH.LOGIN` and `HOME`). Real routes get added as the storyboard defines each screen — don't pre-build a route map speculatively.

### Backend changes required to support a second frontend origin (2026-07-15)

Standing up `web-next` on a different port than `apps/web` exposed that CORS was hardcoded to a single origin in **two places**, not one:
1. Each service's `main.ts` (`app.enableCors({ origin: [configService.getOrThrow('FRONTEND_DOMAIN')] })`) — now parses `FRONTEND_DOMAIN` as a comma-separated list (`.split(',').map(o => o.trim())`) instead of wrapping the raw string in an array. Applied identically across all 7 services (trade-directory, risk-operation, customer-relationship-management, document-management, notification, knowledge-graph, risk-agent). Each `apps/*/.env` (gitignored, local-only) is now `FRONTEND_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:3002`.
2. **The nginx gateway (`nginx/default.conf`) was the actual enforcing layer**, not the NestJS-level config above — it hardcoded `set $cors_origin "http://localhost:3001"` and used `proxy_hide_header` to strip whatever CORS headers each backend service set, replacing them with its own static ones. Fixed with an nginx `map $http_origin $cors_origin { default ""; "~^http://localhost:(3001|3002)$" $http_origin; }` — reflects the request Origin only if it's an allowed local dev frontend, empty (blocked) otherwise. No wildcard, per the existing CORS security requirement. **If a third frontend origin is ever needed, update the regex in this map, not just the `.env` files** — the `.env` change alone silently does nothing while this nginx config is in front of it.

Container-ops notes surfaced while fixing this (useful beyond this specific change):
- **`docker compose restart <service>` does not re-read `.env`/`env_file` changes** — only `docker compose up -d` (or `--force-recreate`) does, since `restart` reuses the existing container's already-resolved environment. If a service isn't picking up an `.env` edit, recreate it, don't just restart it.
- **nginx caches upstream container IPs at its own startup** and does not re-resolve on a backend container's IP change (e.g. after that backend was recreated) — if a service is healthy but the gateway still 502s it with "connect() failed... while connecting to upstream," restart `backend-gateway` too.
- **The `kafka` container can silently exit (OOM or otherwise) independently of the app services** — every dependent service will crash-loop with `KafkaJSConnectionError: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND kafka`, which looks identical to the already-documented "fresh boot" flake below but has a different fix: `docker compose ps kafka` to check it's actually `Up`, `docker compose up -d kafka` if not, *then* restart the dependent services — restarting them alone won't help if kafka itself is down.
- Fixed a genuine pre-existing bug found via this process: `libs/common/src/apps/trade-directory/proto-converter.ts`'s `OrganizationProtoConverter`/`PersonProtoConverter.convertToApp` were missing the `organizationDocuments`/`supportingDocuments` fields added to the `Organization`/`Person` entities during the 2026-07-14 document-tables work, which broke `customer-relationship-management-service`'s webpack build (`TS2741`) the moment it was rebuilt fresh. Both now explicitly set to `undefined`, matching the existing pattern for other app-only, non-proto-carried relations (e.g. `kycAgencyReports`).

**Build strategy: parallel app, not in-place.** The new frontend is
built in a new app directory (working name `apps/web-next`) alongside
the existing `apps/web`, which keeps running untouched for local dev
and as a working reference during the build. Cutover (routing/deploy
swap) happens only once the new app is ready. Chosen over deleting and
rebuilding `apps/web` in place, which would leave no working reference
app during what's likely a multi-week effort.

**`ui-ux-pro-max`'s role expands with this decision.** The existing
2026-07-07 decision ("No per-domain design-system page overrides"
under Coding Conventions → Frontend) scoped the plugin to
design-system tokens only for the *Mantine* app, because its
auto-generated per-page overrides were generic e-commerce/marketing
templates and were discarded. In the new app its ui-styling skill
becomes the actual component library and layout tooling, not just a
token source — Tailwind utility classes are already used in a few
places in the current app (e.g. `Login.tsx`), so this is a change of
degree, not 100% new tooling. Actual page/screen structure still comes
from Tony's own storyboard/navigation spec, not auto-generated by the
plugin — that constraint carries forward unchanged.

**How to apply in the meantime:** the current `apps/web` is now
effectively legacy/frozen-in-spirit — don't invest in deepening its
Mantine/Redux pattern (no new Redux slices, no new bespoke state
wiring, no new Mantine-heavy screens) since it's being replaced
wholesale, not migrated screen-by-screen. Keep it running and
functional for reference and local dev until cutover, but treat any
further work on it as maintenance, not investment.

## Planned: Dynamic RBAC, Multi-Tenancy and Role-Based Dashboard

### Current state — permissions
Permissions are hardcoded in
libs/common/src/modules/casl/casl-ability.factory.ts.
Roles and what they can do are written by a developer and require a
code change and redeployment to update. Several roles exist in
OrganizationPersonRoleEnum but have no CASL rules yet:
- RISK_OFFICER (no rules)
- CLIENT / borrower (no rules)
- SQFSYS (no rules)

### Requirement — dynamic RBAC
The system will support multiple tenants. Each tenant (Funder
organisation) must be able to configure their own permission sets
through a Super Admin portal without requiring a code change or
redeployment.

**Note on "multiple tenants" here (2026-07-17):** in production each
Funder runs in its own isolated deployment (see "Planned: SQFSYS
Admin Portal" and the deployment-isolation note under Multi-Tenancy &
Data Governance) — this Super Admin portal and its `role_permission`
table are a **per-deployment** feature each Funder's own Super Admin
configures for their own instance, not a shared screen across Funders.
`funderPersonaId` scoping stays in the design below because it's
already the implemented tenant-scoping mechanism and remains useful
within a single Funder's deployment (and for today's shared dev/test
environment, where multiple orgs coexist) — but it is not the
production isolation boundary. Build against the design below as
written; the deployment-model reconciliation is a documentation flag,
not a blocker for this work.

A Super Admin will access a dedicated admin portal and perform
three functions:
1. User management — create internal staff accounts, set credentials,
   assign users to the organisation
2. Role management — define roles and configure exactly what each
   role can do (which actions on which resources with which conditions)
3. Role assignment — assign one or more roles to a user

### Role design decision
Use global role names with tenant-specific permissions (Option B).
Every tenant shares the same role names (RISK_OFFICER, CLIENT_COVERAGE
etc.) defined in OrganizationPersonRoleEnum, but each tenant's Super
Admin configures what those roles can do independently. Do NOT build
fully custom role names per tenant at this stage — that can be added
later when genuinely needed.

### Database changes required (future sprint)
A new role_permission table is needed:

role_permission
──────────────────────────────────────────
id               PK
funderPersonaId  int     (tenant scope — each tenant owns their rules)
roleName         varchar (e.g. RISK_OFFICER)
action           varchar (create/read/update/delete/manage)
subject          varchar (Application/ClientAssignee/all)
conditions       jsonb?  (e.g. { "assigneePersonId": "{{userId}}" })
createdAt / updatedAt

Every write to role_permission and organization_person_role must be
timestamped and attributed to the Super Admin who made the change
(audit log — Bank Negara compliance requirement).

### CaslAbilityFactory update required
CaslAbilityFactory must be updated to load rules from the
role_permission table at runtime, scoped to the current user's
funderPersonaId, instead of reading from hardcoded if/else blocks.

### Current tables that already support this design
These tables exist in trade-directory and will be driven by the
new admin portal UI:
- organization_role — role definitions per org
- organization_person_role — user-to-role assignments
- organization_person — user membership per org

### Impact on current development
- Token/auth refactor (Stages 1-5 in CLAUDE.md): not affected,
  proceed as planned
- Payment microservice: when adding permission checks, use a
  stub/placeholder that reads from the future role_permission table
  rather than adding new hardcoded CASL rules
- New screens and endpoints: add a comment documenting which role
  should have access, but do NOT implement as hardcoded CASL rules
- Do NOT add new hardcoded rules to casl-ability.factory.ts
- Do NOT add new roles to OrganizationPersonRoleEnum without a
  corresponding database-driven permissions design

---

### Requirement — role-based dashboard
Each user sees a personalised dashboard showing only the domains,
features and work items relevant to their role. Forbidden errors
must never appear — if a user cannot access something it simply
does not appear in their navigation at all.

### Permissions manifest
After login the frontend calls a single backend endpoint that
returns a permissions manifest for that user. The frontend renders
the dashboard from this manifest — no hardcoded role checks in
React components. This means a Super Admin can update a role's
permissions and the affected user's dashboard reflects the change
on their next login with no frontend code change.

The manifest includes:
- User identity (name, role label, avatar)
- Navigation structure (domains, items, routes, permitted: true/false)
- Work queue (items requiring attention today, driven by application
  status and tenant scope)

### Domain structure
The following domains and their target roles define the navigation
architecture:

Credit Risk             → Risk Officer
  Application queue, risk assessment, risk models (view),
  risk profiles (view), KYC agency report view

Client Onboarding       → Relationship Manager
& Relationship Mgmt       Applicant list, application form,
                          client list, site visit reports

Customer Relationship   → RM Team Lead / Admin
Management                Role assignment, client assignee

Document Management     → RM / Risk Officer / Document Officer
                          Document upload, extraction review,
                          document approval (PENDING_REVIEW)

Configuration           → Super Admin
& Administration          Risk models (edit), risk profiles (edit),
                          organisation directory, user management,
                          role management, audit log

Finance                 → Finance Officer (to be built)
                          Transactions, payment processing,
                          ledger view

Compliance              → Compliance Officer (to be built)
                          Compliance checks, audit log

### Work queue design
Each role has a work queue driven by application status and tenant
scope (funderPersonaId). Examples:

Risk Officer queue:
  Applications with status IN (PENDING_RISK_FILTER_1, PENDING_RISK_FILTER_2)
  scoped to the user's funderPersonaId
  ordered by updatedAt ASC (oldest first)
  No assigneePersonId filter — risk officers share a team queue
  and self-assign

Relationship Manager queue:
  Applications with assigneePersonId = this user's personId
  AND status IN (PENDING_CLIENT_SUBMISSION, PENDING_ASSIGNEE_REVIEW)
  ordered by updatedAt ASC

Adding individual assignment within the risk team (senior assigns
to junior) requires a riskAssigneePersonId column on the application
table — design this before implementing if needed.

### Dashboard design principles
1. Personalised per role — each role sees only their domain
2. Navigation driven by permissions manifest from backend
3. No hardcoded role checks in React components
4. Work queue driven by application status + tenant scope
5. Features that are not permitted do not appear — no greyed-out
   or disabled items, no forbidden errors
6. Information architecture must be designed before any code is
   written — get the structure right first

### Dashboard implementation notes for Claude Code
When building the dashboard:
- Design information architecture before writing any code
- The permissions manifest endpoint must be built in trade-directory
  alongside the dynamic RBAC work — not as a hardcoded role map
- Each new microservice (payment, compliance) must register its
  resources in the permissions framework from day one
- The dashboard layout decision (sidebar vs top nav vs domain cards)
  affects the manifest structure — agree on this before building
  the backend endpoint

## Authentication & Login Security Requirements

New Horizons is a licensed financial platform handling loan disbursements. All authentication code must meet the security standards below. These are **go-live requirements**, not aspirational goals.

---

### Token Security (Priority Order)

**Priority 1 — Hashed refresh tokens (implement first)**
- Never store raw tokens in the database.
- Store only bcrypt.hash(refreshToken, 10) in a refreshTokenHash varchar column.
- Compare using bcrypt.compare() on each refresh call.
- Eliminates database breach impact on active sessions.

**Priority 2 — Refresh token rotation**
- On every /auth/refresh call: delete the old token hash, issue and store a new one.
- The client must replace its stored refresh token on every successful refresh response.
- Detects token theft — a replayed token will fail because it has already been rotated out.

**Priority 3 — httpOnly cookies (coordinated frontend + backend change)**
- Move the refresh token out of Redux/localStorage into an httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie.
- Keep the access token in memory only (React state / closure) — never persist to localStorage.
- This is required by Bank Negara Malaysia internet banking security guidelines.

**Priority 4 — Token family tracking (full RFC 6749 model)**
- Assign each login session a familyId.
- If rotation detects reuse of an already-rotated token (stolen token replayed), invalidate **all** sessions for that user and send a security alert email.

---

### Brute Force & Rate Limiting

- Use @nestjs/throttler to rate-limit the /auth/login endpoint.
- Policy: maximum 5 failed attempts per account per 15-minute window.
- After 5 failures: lock the account, log the event, and email the account owner immediately.
- Rate limit by both IP address and account identifier to resist distributed attacks.

---

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- TOTP-based MFA (compatible with Google Authenticator / Authy) is required for all user roles that can initiate or approve disbursements.
- On first login after MFA is enabled, present a QR code generated with otplib.
- Store only the TOTP secret (encrypted at rest), never the OTP code.
- Bank Negara will ask about MFA — it must be present before licensing review.

---

### Audit Logging (Append-Only)

Create a dedicated auth_audit_log table. Log the following events with timestamp, userId, ipAddress, userAgent, and outcome:

- Login attempt (success and failure)
- Token refresh
- Password change or reset
- Account lockout triggered
- MFA verification (success and failure)
- Logout

This table must be append-only — no UPDATE or DELETE permissions on it. It is the evidence trail for regulatory audits.

---

### Password Policy

Enforce at registration and password-change time:

- Minimum 12 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol.
- Check the submitted password against the HaveIBeenPwned API (k-anonymity model — only the first 5 chars of the SHA-1 hash are sent, no plaintext leaves the server).
- Reject any password found in the breach database.
- Block common patterns: sequences, repeated characters, the application name.

---

### Transport & CORS

- All traffic must be HTTPS. No HTTP fallback permitted in any environment except local development.
- Set Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains on all responses.
- CORS must be locked to the exact frontend origin — no wildcards (origin: '*' is not acceptable in any non-local environment).
- Audit the NestJS CORS config at main.ts before each environment promotion.

---

### Login Anomaly Detection (Post Go-Live)

- Flag logins from a country or device not seen in the user's last 30 days.
- Before allowing any disbursement action in the flagged session, require re-verification (email OTP or MFA).
- This is the highest-effort item and may be deferred to the first post-launch sprint, but must be in the roadmap.
